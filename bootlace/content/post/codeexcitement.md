Coalescing more and more ideas. Nothing new there, but actually getting excited about organising them in order of complexity and actually working through them.
<!--more-->

Rapidly approaching my 50s and been coding since I was 11, somehow having done very little in the way of personal projects in the last decade. I'm a gamer, I'm a coder, and a creator, and want to make my own games for me<sup>*1</sup>, but working in the industry makes this hard. You will assign all ideas and IP over to your employer in the games industry, because... 

Still I'm excited about some simple stuff that I'll initially work on. It's kind of nice to be coding at my own computer, at my own desk, listening to my music through speakers! and just not worrying about 3rd party expectations and timelines. Just a shame it's happening at the end of the day when I'm tired.

<sup>*1</sup> hopefully others will enjoy too :)
